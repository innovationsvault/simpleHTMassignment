This is a simple website to create school or work assignments in. 
This provides a basic framework to create assignments in HTML rather than Word or another word processing software.

Basic usage: 
Copy file and replace text in the pages with actual text for the assignment.
More pages can be added as required (or removed).
All of the editing is done with a text editor (like Atom) and the pages are structured in HTML.
From the main page there are links to each section/question. And each page has links to the other pages or the main page.
Images and styles are to be updated as needed.
There is currently no inclusion of script.

The site includes a 'main' (index) page and then two parts: 
  - Template, how to structure the basic page. This includes examples of all the major formats used in the site. 
  - Format Grabber, a page that has the formats for copy/paste into another page.

Formats included: 
  - Main page using flexbox
  - Question headers and sub-part questions headers
  - Basic table
  - Examples of linked images and embedded video
  - Citations in the footer

Future: build this as a web-application/form where pages, questions, answers, text, etc. is added via the webpage itself. 

Enjoy!
